This constitutes my _third_ entry to the [TIGsource Commonplace Book Competition](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=3286.0).

  
  
It's a work produced by myself the STUPENDOUS [mightypea](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?action=profile;u=991) at [tigjam](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=3593.0), finished recently on a bustrip from Dublin to Galway.  Owing to music-related HASSLE, there's none (there are sound effects though.  Music may be added later).  I hope the silence will intensify the abject horror of this work.  
  
enjoy...
