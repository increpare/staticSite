Fascinated by the efforts of Terry, in his game [squish](http://distractionware.com/blog/?p=254), a retro demake of [crush](http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/crush/), as well as [fez](http://www.kokoromi.org/), I started off on a small series of studies on 1/2-dimensional variations of the mechanic common to those games. I have four done so far; I tend to put one out whenever I'm having a particularly idle evening. The control system in them is a bit deficient, and the graphics are very basic: the point was to explore the mechanic rather than produce something polished.

The basic prototype, blocks prohibit movement when squished.
