A small/medium-sized though still rather experimental effort.

Update:

Tommo Zhou, of [indie-g](http://www.indie-g.com), has made a chinese translation of the game into blitzmax. It can be downloaded from [this page](http://www.indie-g.com/wp/?p=366) on his site. I'm hosting copies here as well:

[Windows (Chinese)](http://ded.increpare.com/~locus/operaomniachinese_win.zip) (4.4MB) [Source (Chinese)](http://ded.increpare.com/~locus/operaomniachinese_src.zip) (14KB)

I did not oversee the translation; the work should be taken on its own merit.

Technically, this is, like, a pre-release; I anticipate I might change a couple of interface things over the next couple of days, but the game itself is done. EDIT: finished version up, along with source EDIT: Okay, that wasn't finished. In fact, it was a bit broken. _Now_ it's finished. EDIT: now XP64-compatible. EDIT: new version released...some slight polishing done... EDIT(24 mar): new version released (1.25); fixed level 18 bug (I hope), and some other small issues
