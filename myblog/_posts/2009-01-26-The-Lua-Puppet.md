Spent the weekend fidgeting about with Lua on my bus trip to/from galway over the weekend (and an hour or two in between). Made a small game inspired by Quinn Dunki's recent effort, [gate](http://www.quinndunki.com/gate/). It's lua-themed, instead of circuit-themed, though. And very short.

**And windows/linux only.** To play the windows version, you'll need to download [lua](â€žhttp://www.lua.org/")
