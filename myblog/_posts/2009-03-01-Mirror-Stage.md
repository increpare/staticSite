The '2 or 3 day' wait until I got this finished is over. It should work with XP 64 now. A small amount of new content has been added (most notably another custom chapter by [Terry](http://www.distractionware.com/)), and the editor has been tarted up a certain amount.

I hope nothing in particular is broke in this build, but if you come across any crashes/&c., I would appreciate very much being told.

The source I must apologise for in advance; it's quite rotten in its organisation.

edit: if you have problem running this on windows 7, try running it in XP SP3 Compatibility Mode
