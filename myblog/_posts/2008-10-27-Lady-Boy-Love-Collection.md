This was my entry to the tigsource [Bootleg Demakes compo](http://tigsource.com/features/demakes/). It features a number of esoteric references, but still might be appreciable by people from elsewhere. It contains four games, in fact, _Lady Million_ _Bio-Collect_ (aka '_Specimen collect_'), _Zeppelin_, and _Sick Panda_.

The original thread for it on tigsource is [here](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=2404.msg60100#msg60100).
