Original tigsource thread [here](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=2161.0).

Portile is a 2d, tile-based take on [narbacular drop](http://www.nuclearmonkeysoftware.com/downloads.html) (more than portal, because I've not played portal, and from what I understand momentum plays a big part in portal, and it doesn't play any part in this).

Controls are LEFT/RIGHT to move, wsad to fire red portal, and shift+wsad to fire blue portal (sorry about the keys dvoraks). E closes all open portals. Most of the stuff one should probably be able to figure out.
