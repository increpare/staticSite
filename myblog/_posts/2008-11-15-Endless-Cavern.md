> _Strange well in Arkham country—water gives out (or was never struck —hole kept tightly covered by a stone ever since dug)—no bottom—shunned and feared—what lay beneath (either unholy temple or other very ancient thing, or great cave-world)._

An entry for the [TIGsource Commonplace Book competition](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=3286.0).

The source is, on the whole, a bit gross, owing partly to my inability to wrap the fmod library properly. If there's any interest _at all_, I can easily make an easy-to-compile soundless and generally tidied-up version of the game available.

**CONTROLS:**

space - to progress through title menus  
left/right - to move left/right  
up/down - to turn off/on 'thrust'  

**PREMISE:**

Procedurally-generated tessellated-cavern flying game of sorts.

**SCREENSHOTS:**
