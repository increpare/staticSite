MathCIV;2004/05/13;;;"Freeciv never seemed mathematically accurate enough for me .. i mean it’s all well and good to just discover gravity and have newton’s workshop, but to do gravity you really do need to have a basic knowledge of synthetic infinitesimal geometry, and to know that you have to know geometry … but on the other hand you should have the opportunity to learn functional analysis and algebra and category theory as your civilisation progresses. You can also not just specify to build a university in your city, but you can also specify what departments you want to build :)<p>
So I took freeciv and added those features to the game :)<p>
MathCIV, as I call it (there’s not much too it really … though it does have a brothel :) ) lurks in the computers section. it’s not terribly well documented, especially re. installation, but if you’ve installed any other mods it shouldn’t be very hard at all to install. If you are having trouble installing it just give me a buzz.<p>
I hope i included all the files (my freeciv directories are a bit of a mess *heh*).<p>
Please though, give it a try and tell me what you think!";;;;;;;;http://www.increpare.com/files/mathciv.zip

lightcone: prototype 1;2008/10/05;lightconetitle.jpg;"and here we have the lovely lovely title screen
";"I always have wanted to program some sort of game using special relativity, but haven't quite figured out a good way to do it yet.  However, I did think, just recently, 'gosh, I should be able to do something with lightcones' though.  So, in this simple concept game light has a finite speed, which basically means that when you see things far away from you, you're not seeing them as they are now, but rather as they were some time in the past.
<p>
I decided on simple laser weapons (which travel at the speed of light), which means that you won't ever see the ones that hit you until it's too late  :D
<p>
Oh, I made it a split-screen two-player game so that you can see for yourself how the two players can see things totally differently.  (but, maybe the screens are on the wrong sides...I'll fix that in the next version  :-X )

<p>
I've not actually tried playing it with anyone yet± I assume that the gameplay potential in its current form is rather minimal, but I think it's still a little bit fun, and I might work more on it in the future.
<p>
And, I have two separate versions (both with sources: the mac ones should compile on linux machines as well...).

Based on Defez, but with blocks that have 'insets'.  This broadens the mechanic somewhat, but was still ultimately limited (though less limited than the first...).  Made a level editor for this one as well, which helped with design a lot.

An observer-dependent one: squishes from either the top/bottom/left/right of the screen.  More limited in many ways, but would be simpler for people to grasp I think (could be implemented as a rotation, like in crush).
